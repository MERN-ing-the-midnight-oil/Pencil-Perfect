        DrawingInterface.js 
             // This is your main component that interacts with the user. It includes the visual rendering of the goal symbol and the user's input, and it communicates with other components to check the accuracy and sequence of the strokes.

        DrawingInterface.module.css 
            // This file contains the styles specific to the DrawingInterface component.

    /StrokeRecorder
        StrokeRecorder.js  
            // This component handles capturing the user's input (i.e., the drawn strokes). It collects the touch events when a user is drawing, and records the path, order, and direction of each stroke. Both teacher while drawing the goal symbol and the student while trying to match it. Teacher: The StrokeRecorder.js will record the strokes as the teacher draws the goal symbol. The teacher's strokes will define the 'correct' sequence and path for the student to follow. It should record not only the path of each stroke, but also the order and direction in which they are made. This information will be used later to analyze the student's strokes.Student: When it's the student's turn to try and replicate the goal symbol, the StrokeRecorder.js will also record the student's strokes. Just like with the teacher, it should capture the path, order, and direction of each stroke.


    /GoalSymbolRenderer
        GoalSymbolRenderer.js  
            // This component handles rendering the goal symbol that the student needs to mimic. It gets the strokes from the teacher input and displays them in correct order. It could show the complete goal symbol in dotted lines, and show the current expected stroke in a solid line.

        GoalSymbolRenderer.module.css // This file contains the styles specific to the GoalSymbolRenderer component.


    /ConditionalRenderer
        ConditionalRenderer.js 
            //Receives each new stroke from the StrokeRecorder.js as soon as it's made.Checks if the stroke is correct (i.e., it matches the next stroke in the sequence of the goal symbol)If the stroke is correct, changes the appearance of the goal symbol as desired.If the stroke is incorrect, provides immediate feedback and discards the stroke.
