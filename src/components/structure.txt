        DrawingInterface.js 
             // This is your main component that interacts with the user. It includes the visual rendering of the goal symbol and the user's input, and it communicates with other components to check the accuracy and sequence of the strokes. The DrawingInterface will interact with the StrokeRecorder to get the data of strokes as they are made, and will also work with the GoalSymbolRenderer to display the goal symbol. It will also use the ConditionalRenderer to get feedback on the student's strokes.

        DrawingInterface.module.css 
            // This file contains the styles specific to the DrawingInterface component. These styles are applied to the elements rendered by the DrawingInterface.js

    /StrokeRecorder
        StrokeRecorder.js  
            // This component handles capturing the user's input (i.e., the drawn strokes). It collects the touch events when a user is drawing, and records the path, order, and direction of each stroke. Both teacher while drawing the goal symbol and the student while trying to match it. The StrokeRecorder will pass this recorded information to both the GoalSymbolRenderer (to display the teacher's strokes as the goal symbol) and the ConditionalRenderer (to analyze the student's strokes). 

    /GoalSymbolRenderer
        GoalSymbolRenderer.js  
            // This component handles rendering the goal symbol that the student needs to mimic. It gets the strokes from the teacher input (passed from the StrokeRecorder) and animates them being drawn in correct order. It works closely with the DrawingInterface to ensure the correct rendering of the goal symbol.

        GoalSymbolRenderer.module.css 
            // This file contains the styles specific to the GoalSymbolRenderer component. These styles are applied to the elements rendered by the GoalSymbolRenderer.js

    /ConditionalRenderer
        ConditionalRenderer.js 
            //Receives each new stroke from the StrokeRecorder.js as soon as it's made. Checks if the stroke is correct (i.e., it matches the next stroke in the sequence of the goal symbol) If the stroke is correct, changes the appearance of the goal symbol as desired. If the stroke is incorrect, provides immediate feedback and discards the stroke. This component communicates with the DrawingInterface to provide immediate feedback to the user. 

        ConditionalRenderer.module.css 
            // This file contains the styles specific to the ConditionalRenderer component. These styles are applied to the elements rendered by the ConditionalRenderer.js
